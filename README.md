Ported a standalone angular component of [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) with <b>trimmed settings</b> to fit my needs. It probably should use directives at some points.

Edit to your liking.

# Usage

add `<app-particles></app-particles>` inside the div you wish to cover with particles.
